abstract classes can be a really
confusing concept when you're learning

00:00:02,950 --> 00:00:02,960
confusing concept when you're learning

java when i was learning they were

00:00:04,070 --> 00:00:04,080
java when i was learning they were

00:00:04,080 --> 00:00:05,349
java when i was learning they were
pretty confusing for me but in this

what an abstract class is how you make

12
00:00:09,110 --> 00:00:09,120
what an abstract class is how you make
 

13
00:00:09,120 --> 00:00:10,629
what an abstract class is how you make
one and how you can use one with an

00:00:10,629 --> 00:00:10,639
one and how you can use one with an
 

15
00:00:10,639 --> 00:00:12,070
one and how you can use one with an
example and why you would want to make

00:00:12,070 --> 00:00:12,080
example and why you would want to make
 

17
00:00:12,080 --> 00:00:13,430
example and why you would want to make
one in the first place we'll also talk

00:00:13,430 --> 00:00:13,440
one in the first place we'll also talk
 

19
00:00:13,440 --> 00:00:15,030
one in the first place we'll also talk
about the differences between abstract

00:00:15,030 --> 00:00:15,040
about the differences between abstract

first things first what is an abstract

40
00:00:30,550 --> 00:00:30,560
first things first what is an abstract
 

41
00:00:30,560 --> 00:00:32,870
first things first what is an abstract
class all an abstract class is is a

42
00:00:32,870 --> 00:00:32,880
class all an abstract class is is a
 

43
00:00:32,880 --> 00:00:35,190
class all an abstract class is is a
class that you can't instantiate you

44
00:00:35,190 --> 00:00:35,200
class that you can't instantiate you
 

45
00:00:35,200 --> 00:00:37,110
class that you can't instantiate you
can't create objects from abstract

46
00:00:37,110 --> 00:00:37,120
can't create objects from abstract
 

47
00:00:37,120 --> 00:00:38,549
can't create objects from abstract
classes so what does that mean well you

48
00:00:38,549 --> 00:00:38,559
classes so what does that mean well you
 

49
00:00:38,559 --> 00:00:40,069
classes so what does that mean well you
know if you have like a normal class

50
00:00:40,069 --> 00:00:40,079
know if you have like a normal class
 

51
00:00:40,079 --> 00:00:42,389
know if you have like a normal class
like this cat class here if you want you

52
00:00:42,389 --> 00:00:42,399
like this cat class here if you want you
 

53
00:00:42,399 --> 00:00:44,310
like this cat class here if you want you
can create objects of that class so you

54
00:00:44,310 --> 00:00:44,320
can create objects of that class so you
 

55
00:00:44,320 --> 00:00:47,830
can create objects of that class so you
could say cat my cat equals new cat but

56
00:00:47,830 --> 00:00:47,840
could say cat my cat equals new cat but
 

57
00:00:47,840 --> 00:00:49,590
could say cat my cat equals new cat but
with abstract classes you can't do this

58
00:00:49,590 --> 00:00:49,600
with abstract classes you can't do this
 

59
00:00:49,600 --> 00:00:51,350
with abstract classes you can't do this
so if i go back into my cat class and

60
00:00:51,350 --> 00:00:51,360
so if i go back into my cat class and
 

61
00:00:51,360 --> 00:00:54,549
so if i go back into my cat class and
make it a public abstract class if i go

62
00:00:54,549 --> 00:00:54,559
make it a public abstract class if i go
 

63
00:00:54,559 --> 00:00:56,229
make it a public abstract class if i go
back into my main method i can see that

64
00:00:56,229 --> 00:00:56,239
back into my main method i can see that
 

65
00:00:56,239 --> 00:00:58,150
back into my main method i can see that
now i get an error here cannot

66
00:00:58,150 --> 00:00:58,160
now i get an error here cannot
 

67
00:00:58,160 --> 00:01:00,470
now i get an error here cannot
instantiate the type cat and by the way

68
00:01:00,470 --> 00:01:00,480
instantiate the type cat and by the way
 

69
00:01:00,480 --> 00:01:02,310
instantiate the type cat and by the way
this abstract keyword here in the class

70
00:01:02,310 --> 00:01:02,320
this abstract keyword here in the class
 

71
00:01:02,320 --> 00:01:04,310
this abstract keyword here in the class
definition is the only thing you need to

72
00:01:04,310 --> 00:01:04,320
definition is the only thing you need to
 

73
00:01:04,320 --> 00:01:06,310
definition is the only thing you need to
make a class into an abstract class

74
00:01:06,310 --> 00:01:06,320
make a class into an abstract class
 

75
00:01:06,320 --> 00:01:07,429
make a class into an abstract class
probably the first question that comes

76
00:01:07,429 --> 00:01:07,439
probably the first question that comes
 

77
00:01:07,439 --> 00:01:09,030
probably the first question that comes
to mind is why the heck would i want to

78
00:01:09,030 --> 00:01:09,040
to mind is why the heck would i want to
 

79
00:01:09,040 --> 00:01:10,710
to mind is why the heck would i want to
do that why would i want to make a class

80
00:01:10,710 --> 00:01:10,720
do that why would i want to make a class
 

81
00:01:10,720 --> 00:01:12,390
do that why would i want to make a class
that i can't create objects from so

82
00:01:12,390 --> 00:01:12,400
that i can't create objects from so
 

83
00:01:12,400 --> 00:01:13,830
that i can't create objects from so
here's a situation where it makes sense

84
00:01:13,830 --> 00:01:13,840
here's a situation where it makes sense
 

85
00:01:13,840 --> 00:01:15,510
here's a situation where it makes sense
to use an abstract class let's change

86
00:01:15,510 --> 00:01:15,520
to use an abstract class let's change
 

87
00:01:15,520 --> 00:01:17,749
to use an abstract class let's change
this class back into a regular class

88
00:01:17,749 --> 00:01:17,759
this class back into a regular class
 

89
00:01:17,759 --> 00:01:19,270
this class back into a regular class
instead of just being a standalone class

90
00:01:19,270 --> 00:01:19,280
instead of just being a standalone class
 

91
00:01:19,280 --> 00:01:21,590
instead of just being a standalone class
let's say it extended a class called

92
00:01:21,590 --> 00:01:21,600
let's say it extended a class called
 

93
00:01:21,600 --> 00:01:23,109
let's say it extended a class called
animal and let's say the animal class

94
00:01:23,109 --> 00:01:23,119
animal and let's say the animal class
 

95
00:01:23,119 --> 00:01:25,350
animal and let's say the animal class
had a couple of fields like int age

96
00:01:25,350 --> 00:01:25,360
had a couple of fields like int age
 

97
00:01:25,360 --> 00:01:27,510
had a couple of fields like int age
string name it totally makes sense that

98
00:01:27,510 --> 00:01:27,520
string name it totally makes sense that
 

99
00:01:27,520 --> 00:01:28,950
string name it totally makes sense that
you could have an animal class that

100
00:01:28,950 --> 00:01:28,960
you could have an animal class that
 

101
00:01:28,960 --> 00:01:31,190
you could have an animal class that
would have subclasses of actual animals

102
00:01:31,190 --> 00:01:31,200
would have subclasses of actual animals
 

103
00:01:31,200 --> 00:01:33,590
would have subclasses of actual animals
like cat dog horse whatever and it makes

104
00:01:33,590 --> 00:01:33,600
like cat dog horse whatever and it makes
 

105
00:01:33,600 --> 00:01:35,350
like cat dog horse whatever and it makes
sense that you could create objects of

106
00:01:35,350 --> 00:01:35,360
sense that you could create objects of
 

107
00:01:35,360 --> 00:01:37,429
sense that you could create objects of
those subclasses like you could create a

108
00:01:37,429 --> 00:01:37,439
those subclasses like you could create a
 

109
00:01:37,439 --> 00:01:39,270
those subclasses like you could create a
cat object but what doesn't make a whole

110
00:01:39,270 --> 00:01:39,280
cat object but what doesn't make a whole
 

111
00:01:39,280 --> 00:01:41,590
cat object but what doesn't make a whole
lot of sense is creating an animal

112
00:01:41,590 --> 00:01:41,600
lot of sense is creating an animal
 

113
00:01:41,600 --> 00:01:43,270
lot of sense is creating an animal
object you know it's just kind of weird

114
00:01:43,270 --> 00:01:43,280
object you know it's just kind of weird
 

115
00:01:43,280 --> 00:01:44,789
object you know it's just kind of weird
what kind of animal is it so you might

116
00:01:44,789 --> 00:01:44,799
what kind of animal is it so you might
 

117
00:01:44,799 --> 00:01:46,630
what kind of animal is it so you might
want a parent class like animal so that

118
00:01:46,630 --> 00:01:46,640
want a parent class like animal so that
 

119
00:01:46,640 --> 00:01:48,710
want a parent class like animal so that
your subclasses can share some fields

120
00:01:48,710 --> 00:01:48,720
your subclasses can share some fields
 

121
00:01:48,720 --> 00:01:50,630
your subclasses can share some fields
like age name and maybe some methods

122
00:01:50,630 --> 00:01:50,640
like age name and maybe some methods
 

123
00:01:50,640 --> 00:01:52,230
like age name and maybe some methods
that you write but you might not want to

124
00:01:52,230 --> 00:01:52,240
that you write but you might not want to
 

125
00:01:52,240 --> 00:01:54,469
that you write but you might not want to
be able to create objects of this animal

126
00:01:54,469 --> 00:01:54,479
be able to create objects of this animal
 

127
00:01:54,479 --> 00:01:56,389
be able to create objects of this animal
class all you have to do is make this

128
00:01:56,389 --> 00:01:56,399
class all you have to do is make this
 

129
00:01:56,399 --> 00:01:58,630
class all you have to do is make this
class abstract so an abstract class is a

130
00:01:58,630 --> 00:01:58,640
class abstract so an abstract class is a
 

131
00:01:58,640 --> 00:02:00,550
class abstract so an abstract class is a
class you can't instantiate but you can

132
00:02:00,550 --> 00:02:00,560
class you can't instantiate but you can
 

133
00:02:00,560 --> 00:02:02,469
class you can't instantiate but you can
absolutely make subclasses of an

134
00:02:02,469 --> 00:02:02,479
absolutely make subclasses of an
 

135
00:02:02,479 --> 00:02:04,950
absolutely make subclasses of an
abstract class that can be instantiated

136
00:02:04,950 --> 00:02:04,960
abstract class that can be instantiated
 

137
00:02:04,960 --> 00:02:07,190
abstract class that can be instantiated
now what about abstract methods in any

138
00:02:07,190 --> 00:02:07,200
now what about abstract methods in any
 

139
00:02:07,200 --> 00:02:09,510
now what about abstract methods in any
of your abstract classes you can choose

140
00:02:09,510 --> 00:02:09,520
of your abstract classes you can choose
 

141
00:02:09,520 --> 00:02:11,430
of your abstract classes you can choose
to have abstract methods let's say we

142
00:02:11,430 --> 00:02:11,440
to have abstract methods let's say we
 

143
00:02:11,440 --> 00:02:14,390
to have abstract methods let's say we
had a method like public void make noise

144
00:02:14,390 --> 00:02:14,400
had a method like public void make noise
 

145
00:02:14,400 --> 00:02:15,750
had a method like public void make noise
of course it makes sense for an animal

146
00:02:15,750 --> 00:02:15,760
of course it makes sense for an animal
 

147
00:02:15,760 --> 00:02:17,589
of course it makes sense for an animal
to be able to make noise but each

148
00:02:17,589 --> 00:02:17,599
to be able to make noise but each
 

149
00:02:17,599 --> 00:02:19,110
to be able to make noise but each
individual animal is going to make noise

150
00:02:19,110 --> 00:02:19,120
individual animal is going to make noise
 

151
00:02:19,120 --> 00:02:20,869
individual animal is going to make noise
in its own way a cat's going to meow a

152
00:02:20,869 --> 00:02:20,879
in its own way a cat's going to meow a
 

153
00:02:20,879 --> 00:02:22,550
in its own way a cat's going to meow a
dog is gonna bark so because of that it

154
00:02:22,550 --> 00:02:22,560
dog is gonna bark so because of that it
 

155
00:02:22,560 --> 00:02:24,150
dog is gonna bark so because of that it
might not make a whole lot of sense to

156
00:02:24,150 --> 00:02:24,160
might not make a whole lot of sense to
 

157
00:02:24,160 --> 00:02:26,070
might not make a whole lot of sense to
actually implement this method make

158
00:02:26,070 --> 00:02:26,080
actually implement this method make
 

159
00:02:26,080 --> 00:02:28,229
actually implement this method make
noise here in your abstract animal class

160
00:02:28,229 --> 00:02:28,239
noise here in your abstract animal class
 

161
00:02:28,239 --> 00:02:30,309
noise here in your abstract animal class
what you can do is make this method an

162
00:02:30,309 --> 00:02:30,319
what you can do is make this method an
 

163
00:02:30,319 --> 00:02:32,390
what you can do is make this method an
abstract method when you make a method

164
00:02:32,390 --> 00:02:32,400
abstract method when you make a method
 

165
00:02:32,400 --> 00:02:35,030
abstract method when you make a method
abstract you don't specify a body for

166
00:02:35,030 --> 00:02:35,040
abstract you don't specify a body for
 

167
00:02:35,040 --> 00:02:36,710
abstract you don't specify a body for
the method all you do is declare it and

168
00:02:36,710 --> 00:02:36,720
the method all you do is declare it and
 

169
00:02:36,720 --> 00:02:38,790
the method all you do is declare it and
then end it with a semicolon but then in

170
00:02:38,790 --> 00:02:38,800
then end it with a semicolon but then in
 

171
00:02:38,800 --> 00:02:40,550
then end it with a semicolon but then in
all the child classes of your abstract

172
00:02:40,550 --> 00:02:40,560
all the child classes of your abstract
 

173
00:02:40,560 --> 00:02:42,070
all the child classes of your abstract
class you have to actually create an

174
00:02:42,070 --> 00:02:42,080
class you have to actually create an
 

175
00:02:42,080 --> 00:02:44,150
class you have to actually create an
implementation of this make noise method

176
00:02:44,150 --> 00:02:44,160
implementation of this make noise method
 

177
00:02:44,160 --> 00:02:45,830
implementation of this make noise method
so if we go back over to our cat class

178
00:02:45,830 --> 00:02:45,840
so if we go back over to our cat class
 

179
00:02:45,840 --> 00:02:47,670
so if we go back over to our cat class
now we can see that it's giving us an

180
00:02:47,670 --> 00:02:47,680
now we can see that it's giving us an
 

181
00:02:47,680 --> 00:02:50,070
now we can see that it's giving us an
error that the type cat must implement

182
00:02:50,070 --> 00:02:50,080
error that the type cat must implement
 

183
00:02:50,080 --> 00:02:52,550
error that the type cat must implement
the inherited abstract method make noise

184
00:02:52,550 --> 00:02:52,560
the inherited abstract method make noise
 

185
00:02:52,560 --> 00:02:53,990
the inherited abstract method make noise
so of course we can write it all out but

186
00:02:53,990 --> 00:02:54,000
so of course we can write it all out but
 

187
00:02:54,000 --> 00:02:56,309
so of course we can write it all out but
we can also just use eclipse's fix tool

188
00:02:56,309 --> 00:02:56,319
we can also just use eclipse's fix tool
 

189
00:02:56,319 --> 00:02:58,550
we can also just use eclipse's fix tool
here to add the unimplemented method but

190
00:02:58,550 --> 00:02:58,560
here to add the unimplemented method but
 

191
00:02:58,560 --> 00:02:59,990
here to add the unimplemented method but
now this cat class can implement this

192
00:02:59,990 --> 00:03:00,000
now this cat class can implement this
 

193
00:03:00,000 --> 00:03:01,990
now this cat class can implement this
make noise method however we want print

194
00:03:01,990 --> 00:03:02,000
make noise method however we want print
 

195
00:03:02,000 --> 00:03:04,710
make noise method however we want print
out meow so because this animal class

196
00:03:04,710 --> 00:03:04,720
out meow so because this animal class
 

197
00:03:04,720 --> 00:03:07,270
out meow so because this animal class
declares an abstract method make noise

198
00:03:07,270 --> 00:03:07,280
declares an abstract method make noise
 

199
00:03:07,280 --> 00:03:09,190
declares an abstract method make noise
any child class of this animal class has

200
00:03:09,190 --> 00:03:09,200
any child class of this animal class has
 

201
00:03:09,200 --> 00:03:11,270
any child class of this animal class has
to provide its own make noise

202
00:03:11,270 --> 00:03:11,280
to provide its own make noise
 

203
00:03:11,280 --> 00:03:12,790
to provide its own make noise
implementation so now back in our main

204
00:03:12,790 --> 00:03:12,800
implementation so now back in our main
 

205
00:03:12,800 --> 00:03:15,110
implementation so now back in our main
method we could take my cat and call

206
00:03:15,110 --> 00:03:15,120
method we could take my cat and call
 

207
00:03:15,120 --> 00:03:16,630
method we could take my cat and call
meow and if we run our program we can

208
00:03:16,630 --> 00:03:16,640
meow and if we run our program we can
 

209
00:03:16,640 --> 00:03:19,190
meow and if we run our program we can
see that it says meow now of course we

210
00:03:19,190 --> 00:03:19,200
see that it says meow now of course we
 

211
00:03:19,200 --> 00:03:20,869
see that it says meow now of course we
could in our animal class you know get

212
00:03:20,869 --> 00:03:20,879
could in our animal class you know get
 

213
00:03:20,879 --> 00:03:23,110
could in our animal class you know get
rid of this abstract method and in our

214
00:03:23,110 --> 00:03:23,120
rid of this abstract method and in our
 

215
00:03:23,120 --> 00:03:25,270
rid of this abstract method and in our
cat class just declare a make noise

216
00:03:25,270 --> 00:03:25,280
cat class just declare a make noise
 

217
00:03:25,280 --> 00:03:27,190
cat class just declare a make noise
method that says meow and if we go back

218
00:03:27,190 --> 00:03:27,200
method that says meow and if we go back
 

219
00:03:27,200 --> 00:03:28,789
method that says meow and if we go back
and run our program again it still says

220
00:03:28,789 --> 00:03:28,799
and run our program again it still says
 

221
00:03:28,799 --> 00:03:31,350
and run our program again it still says
meow so why do we need this abstract

222
00:03:31,350 --> 00:03:31,360
meow so why do we need this abstract
 

223
00:03:31,360 --> 00:03:32,949
meow so why do we need this abstract
method what do we want that for what the

224
00:03:32,949 --> 00:03:32,959
method what do we want that for what the
 

225
00:03:32,959 --> 00:03:34,869
method what do we want that for what the
abstract class does as a whole is kind

226
00:03:34,869 --> 00:03:34,879
abstract class does as a whole is kind
 

227
00:03:34,879 --> 00:03:38,309
abstract class does as a whole is kind
of enforce and organize exactly what

228
00:03:38,309 --> 00:03:38,319
of enforce and organize exactly what
 

229
00:03:38,319 --> 00:03:40,949
of enforce and organize exactly what
every subclass of animal has to have so

230
00:03:40,949 --> 00:03:40,959
every subclass of animal has to have so
 

231
00:03:40,959 --> 00:03:42,309
every subclass of animal has to have so
this animal class is saying hey if you

232
00:03:42,309 --> 00:03:42,319
this animal class is saying hey if you
 

233
00:03:42,319 --> 00:03:44,149
this animal class is saying hey if you
want to create a new type of animal it's

234
00:03:44,149 --> 00:03:44,159
want to create a new type of animal it's
 

235
00:03:44,159 --> 00:03:45,350
want to create a new type of animal it's
going to have an age it's going to have

236
00:03:45,350 --> 00:03:45,360
going to have an age it's going to have
 

237
00:03:45,360 --> 00:03:46,710
going to have an age it's going to have
a name and it has to be able to make

238
00:03:46,710 --> 00:03:46,720
a name and it has to be able to make
 

239
00:03:46,720 --> 00:03:48,229
a name and it has to be able to make
noise every type of animal might make

240
00:03:48,229 --> 00:03:48,239
noise every type of animal might make
 

241
00:03:48,239 --> 00:03:49,830
noise every type of animal might make
noise in completely different ways but

242
00:03:49,830 --> 00:03:49,840
noise in completely different ways but
 

243
00:03:49,840 --> 00:03:51,830
noise in completely different ways but
this makes sure that every single animal

244
00:03:51,830 --> 00:03:51,840
this makes sure that every single animal
 

245
00:03:51,840 --> 00:03:53,990
this makes sure that every single animal
type is able to make noise as a side

246
00:03:53,990 --> 00:03:54,000
type is able to make noise as a side
 

247
00:03:54,000 --> 00:03:55,910
type is able to make noise as a side
note though in your abstract class all

248
00:03:55,910 --> 00:03:55,920
note though in your abstract class all
 

249
00:03:55,920 --> 00:03:57,350
note though in your abstract class all
of the methods don't necessarily have to

250
00:03:57,350 --> 00:03:57,360
of the methods don't necessarily have to
 

251
00:03:57,360 --> 00:03:59,670
of the methods don't necessarily have to
be abstract you can create actual

252
00:03:59,670 --> 00:03:59,680
be abstract you can create actual
 

253
00:03:59,680 --> 00:04:01,509
be abstract you can create actual
concrete implemented methods in your

254
00:04:01,509 --> 00:04:01,519
concrete implemented methods in your
 

255
00:04:01,519 --> 00:04:03,030
concrete implemented methods in your
abstract classes so you could have like

256
00:04:03,030 --> 00:04:03,040
abstract classes so you could have like
 

257
00:04:03,040 --> 00:04:05,990
abstract classes so you could have like
public void print name just prints my

258
00:04:05,990 --> 00:04:06,000
public void print name just prints my
 

259
00:04:06,000 --> 00:04:08,869
public void print name just prints my
name is name so now every subclass of

260
00:04:08,869 --> 00:04:08,879
name is name so now every subclass of
 

261
00:04:08,879 --> 00:04:10,229
name is name so now every subclass of
animal will also have this print name

262
00:04:10,229 --> 00:04:10,239
animal will also have this print name
 

263
00:04:10,239 --> 00:04:11,670
animal will also have this print name
method available to it but since it's

264
00:04:11,670 --> 00:04:11,680
method available to it but since it's
 

265
00:04:11,680 --> 00:04:12,789
method available to it but since it's
not abstract they don't need to

266
00:04:12,789 --> 00:04:12,799
not abstract they don't need to
 

267
00:04:12,799 --> 00:04:14,229
not abstract they don't need to
implement it themselves they can just

268
00:04:14,229 --> 00:04:14,239
implement it themselves they can just
 

269
00:04:14,239 --> 00:04:15,750
implement it themselves they can just
use the implementation that's here the

270
00:04:15,750 --> 00:04:15,760
use the implementation that's here the
 

271
00:04:15,760 --> 00:04:17,430
use the implementation that's here the
question a lot of people have and what's

272
00:04:17,430 --> 00:04:17,440
question a lot of people have and what's
 

273
00:04:17,440 --> 00:04:19,430
question a lot of people have and what's
actually also a big interview question

274
00:04:19,430 --> 00:04:19,440
actually also a big interview question
 

275
00:04:19,440 --> 00:04:20,870
actually also a big interview question
is what's the difference between an

276
00:04:20,870 --> 00:04:20,880
is what's the difference between an
 

277
00:04:20,880 --> 00:04:22,950
is what's the difference between an
abstract class and an interface let's

278
00:04:22,950 --> 00:04:22,960
abstract class and an interface let's
 

279
00:04:22,960 --> 00:04:25,749
abstract class and an interface let's
say we had an interface called like

280
00:04:25,749 --> 00:04:25,759
say we had an interface called like
 

281
00:04:25,759 --> 00:04:28,310
say we had an interface called like
animal stuff here in an interface we

282
00:04:28,310 --> 00:04:28,320
animal stuff here in an interface we
 

283
00:04:28,320 --> 00:04:31,510
animal stuff here in an interface we
could say how about public void poop

284
00:04:31,510 --> 00:04:31,520
could say how about public void poop
 

285
00:04:31,520 --> 00:04:32,950
could say how about public void poop
just like every animal might make noise

286
00:04:32,950 --> 00:04:32,960
just like every animal might make noise
 

287
00:04:32,960 --> 00:04:34,469
just like every animal might make noise
in different ways every animal is

288
00:04:34,469 --> 00:04:34,479
in different ways every animal is
 

289
00:04:34,479 --> 00:04:35,749
in different ways every animal is
probably also going to poop in different

290
00:04:35,749 --> 00:04:35,759
probably also going to poop in different
 

291
00:04:35,759 --> 00:04:37,670
probably also going to poop in different
ways in interfaces you don't need an

292
00:04:37,670 --> 00:04:37,680
ways in interfaces you don't need an
 

293
00:04:37,680 --> 00:04:39,350
ways in interfaces you don't need an
abstract keyword in your methods every

294
00:04:39,350 --> 00:04:39,360
abstract keyword in your methods every
 

295
00:04:39,360 --> 00:04:41,110
abstract keyword in your methods every
method in an interface is assumed to be

296
00:04:41,110 --> 00:04:41,120
method in an interface is assumed to be
 

297
00:04:41,120 --> 00:04:42,950
method in an interface is assumed to be
abstract so you uh you don't need this

298
00:04:42,950 --> 00:04:42,960
abstract so you uh you don't need this
 

299
00:04:42,960 --> 00:04:44,550
abstract so you uh you don't need this
keyword as you probably know if you want

300
00:04:44,550 --> 00:04:44,560
keyword as you probably know if you want
 

301
00:04:44,560 --> 00:04:46,629
keyword as you probably know if you want
to implement an interface so all you

302
00:04:46,629 --> 00:04:46,639
to implement an interface so all you
 

303
00:04:46,639 --> 00:04:48,550
to implement an interface so all you
have to do is instead of extending

304
00:04:48,550 --> 00:04:48,560
have to do is instead of extending
 

305
00:04:48,560 --> 00:04:50,469
have to do is instead of extending
another class you just say

306
00:04:50,469 --> 00:04:50,479
another class you just say
 

307
00:04:50,479 --> 00:04:53,110
another class you just say
implements the interface which is animal

308
00:04:53,110 --> 00:04:53,120
implements the interface which is animal
 

309
00:04:53,120 --> 00:04:54,710
implements the interface which is animal
stuff and now that we implement this

310
00:04:54,710 --> 00:04:54,720
stuff and now that we implement this
 

311
00:04:54,720 --> 00:04:56,629
stuff and now that we implement this
animal stuff interface we have to

312
00:04:56,629 --> 00:04:56,639
animal stuff interface we have to
 

313
00:04:56,639 --> 00:04:58,550
animal stuff interface we have to
implement this poop method you see right

314
00:04:58,550 --> 00:04:58,560
implement this poop method you see right
 

315
00:04:58,560 --> 00:05:00,230
implement this poop method you see right
now we get an error that says type cat

316
00:05:00,230 --> 00:05:00,240
now we get an error that says type cat
 

317
00:05:00,240 --> 00:05:02,390
now we get an error that says type cat
must implement the inherited abstract

318
00:05:02,390 --> 00:05:02,400
must implement the inherited abstract
 

319
00:05:02,400 --> 00:05:03,990
must implement the inherited abstract
method poop we can just click the

classes that implement the interface

336
00:05:19,189 --> 00:05:19,199
classes that implement the interface
 

337
00:05:19,199 --> 00:05:20,550
classes that implement the interface
implement this method they seem like

they're doing the same thing right
what's the difference the first key

342
00:05:23,029 --> 00:05:23,039
what's the difference the first key
 

343
00:05:23,039 --> 00:05:25,110
what's the difference the first key
difference is that you can implement as

344
00:05:25,110 --> 00:05:25,120
difference is that you can implement as
 

345
00:05:25,120 --> 00:05:27,110
difference is that you can implement as
many interfaces as you want in java

346
00:05:27,110 --> 00:05:27,120
many interfaces as you want in java
 

347
00:05:27,120 --> 00:05:29,270
many interfaces as you want in java
there's no limit but you can only extend

348
00:05:29,270 --> 00:05:29,280
there's no limit but you can only extend
 

349
00:05:29,280 --> 00:05:31,189
there's no limit but you can only extend
one class and you can totally do both if

350
00:05:31,189 --> 00:05:31,199
one class and you can totally do both if
 

351
00:05:31,199 --> 00:05:32,950
one class and you can totally do both if
you want to you can extend the animal

352
00:05:32,950 --> 00:05:32,960
you want to you can extend the animal
 

353
00:05:32,960 --> 00:05:35,029
you want to you can extend the animal
class and implement the animal stuff

354
00:05:35,029 --> 00:05:35,039
class and implement the animal stuff
 

355
00:05:35,039 --> 00:05:36,870
class and implement the animal stuff
interface another difference is that in

356
00:05:36,870 --> 00:05:36,880
interface another difference is that in
 

357
00:05:36,880 --> 00:05:39,110
interface another difference is that in
interfaces if you declare any fields

358
00:05:39,110 --> 00:05:39,120
interfaces if you declare any fields
 

359
00:05:39,120 --> 00:05:42,310
interfaces if you declare any fields
like if you had end age and string name

360
00:05:42,310 --> 00:05:42,320
like if you had end age and string name
 

361
00:05:42,320 --> 00:05:43,830
like if you had end age and string name
every field that's declared inside an

362
00:05:43,830 --> 00:05:43,840
every field that's declared inside an
 

363
00:05:43,840 --> 00:05:46,070
every field that's declared inside an
interface is going to be static and

364
00:05:46,070 --> 00:05:46,080
interface is going to be static and
 

365
00:05:46,080 --> 00:05:47,510
interface is going to be static and
final that's why i'm getting an error

366
00:05:47,510 --> 00:05:47,520
final that's why i'm getting an error
 

367
00:05:47,520 --> 00:05:49,189
final that's why i'm getting an error
here because it's final i have to

368
00:05:49,189 --> 00:05:49,199
here because it's final i have to
 

369
00:05:49,199 --> 00:05:51,110
here because it's final i have to
instantiate it with some kind of a value

370
00:05:51,110 --> 00:05:51,120
instantiate it with some kind of a value
 

371
00:05:51,120 --> 00:05:53,029
instantiate it with some kind of a value
larry because every field in an

372
00:05:53,029 --> 00:05:53,039
larry because every field in an
 

373
00:05:53,039 --> 00:05:54,950
larry because every field in an
interface is automatically static that

374
00:05:54,950 --> 00:05:54,960
interface is automatically static that
 

375
00:05:54,960 --> 00:05:57,189
interface is automatically static that
means the same values apply to every

376
00:05:57,189 --> 00:05:57,199
means the same values apply to every
 

377
00:05:57,199 --> 00:05:59,990
means the same values apply to every
object in that class if i say age equals

378
00:05:59,990 --> 00:06:00,000
object in that class if i say age equals
 

379
00:06:00,000 --> 00:06:01,909
object in that class if i say age equals
one that would have to apply to every

380
00:06:01,909 --> 00:06:01,919
one that would have to apply to every
 

381
00:06:01,919 --> 00:06:03,830
one that would have to apply to every
class that implements this interface so

382
00:06:03,830 --> 00:06:03,840
class that implements this interface so
 

383
00:06:03,840 --> 00:06:04,950
class that implements this interface so
it really doesn't make a whole lot of

384
00:06:04,950 --> 00:06:04,960
it really doesn't make a whole lot of
 

385
00:06:04,960 --> 00:06:07,270
it really doesn't make a whole lot of
sense to have fields like this inside

386
00:06:07,270 --> 00:06:07,280
sense to have fields like this inside
 

387
00:06:07,280 --> 00:06:10,230
sense to have fields like this inside
interfaces that's why we have abstract

388
00:06:10,230 --> 00:06:10,240
interfaces that's why we have abstract
 

389
00:06:10,240 --> 00:06:11,909
interfaces that's why we have abstract
classes like this so you can say hey

390
00:06:11,909 --> 00:06:11,919
classes like this so you can say hey
 

391
00:06:11,919 --> 00:06:14,390
classes like this so you can say hey
every animal has to have an age and a

392
00:06:14,390 --> 00:06:14,400
every animal has to have an age and a
 

393
00:06:14,400 --> 00:06:15,830
every animal has to have an age and a
name but i'm not going to tell you what

394
00:06:15,830 --> 00:06:15,840
name but i'm not going to tell you what
 

395
00:06:15,840 --> 00:06:16,790
name but i'm not going to tell you what
it is right now because that doesn't

396
00:06:16,790 --> 00:06:16,800
it is right now because that doesn't
 

397
00:06:16,800 --> 00:06:19,350
it is right now because that doesn't
make sense each individual cat object

398
00:06:19,350 --> 00:06:19,360
make sense each individual cat object
 

399
00:06:19,360 --> 00:06:21,430
make sense each individual cat object
dog object and horse object can all have

400
00:06:21,430 --> 00:06:21,440
dog object and horse object can all have
 

401
00:06:21,440 --> 00:06:23,830
dog object and horse object can all have
their own age and name values so you can

402
00:06:23,830 --> 00:06:23,840
their own age and name values so you can
 

403
00:06:23,840 --> 00:06:26,070
their own age and name values so you can
do that with an abstract class but not

404
00:06:26,070 --> 00:06:26,080
do that with an abstract class but not
 

405
00:06:26,080 --> 00:06:27,590
do that with an abstract class but not
with an interface so you might want to

406
00:06:27,590 --> 00:06:27,600
with an interface so you might want to
 

407
00:06:27,600 --> 00:06:29,510
with an interface so you might want to
create an abstract class if you have a

408
00:06:29,510 --> 00:06:29,520
create an abstract class if you have a
 

409
00:06:29,520 --> 00:06:31,590
create an abstract class if you have a
lot of closely related classes that you

410
00:06:31,590 --> 00:06:31,600
lot of closely related classes that you
 

411
00:06:31,600 --> 00:06:33,350
lot of closely related classes that you
want to have the same functionality and

00:06:33,350 --> 00:06:33,360
want to have the same functionality and
 

413
00:06:33,360 --> 00:06:35,270
want to have the same functionality and
the same types of fields available but

00:06:35,270 --> 00:06:35,280
the same types of fields available but
 

415
00:06:35,280 --> 00:06:36,710
the same types of fields available but
you might want to make an interface

416
00:06:36,710 --> 00:06:36,720
you might want to make an interface
 

417
00:06:36,720 --> 00:06:39,029
you might want to make an interface
